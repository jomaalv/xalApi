HOW TO CONNECT TO POSTGRES DB to check constraint and schemas
	docker exec -it postgres psql -U postgres -d xaldigit
	
	FOR CHECK CONSTRAINT WORKS:
	INSERT INTO person (first_name, state) VALUES ('Alison', 'A2');
	
	FOR CHECK SCHEMAS API WORKS:
	\dn
	
FOR UNIT TESTING AND COVERAGE
	In the host SO of docker container install python and coverage library 
	pip install coverage
	
	Then in test_coverage>test_cov_api.py you must have to replace URL_API with the current URL-PATH where "web_1".
	
	coverage run test_cov_api.py
	coverage report
